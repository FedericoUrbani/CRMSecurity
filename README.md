# CRMSecurity

Hi Everyone this is a simple security project with java (1.8). Is configurated to work also on higer version of java.
Utilize jwt token and is simply a project that show how can actually work a configuration with this tecnology.
Hope this can be helpful.
This project also allows connection from the localhost:3306 wich is the React default port. If u plan to create a project
using react + spring boot + sql + security with jwt token this can might be a good start point.
Hf programmers.
